## Background and Question 

The data was provided by UMD (Urban Ministry of Durham). Established in 1983, Urban Ministries of Durham works holistically to end homelessness and meet the emergency needs of very poor and hungry neighbors through its programs and in partnership with other nonprofits. UMD is a private, 501(c) 3 non-profit organization governed by a volunteer Board of Directors from the community. UMD offers food, shelter and a future to about 6,000 men, women and children annually. 

My focus of this project is to look at the trend of the amount of food provided for and the number of people for whcih the food was provided before 2000, between 2000 and 2010, and on and after 2010. 

## Data Source and Variables of Interest 

Data was provided by UMD (Urban Ministry of Durham). The data is consisted of 79838 observations and 13 variables (5 categorical variables and 8 numerical variables) from years 1931 to 2019. I think the variables Date, Food Pounds, and Clothing Items will be useful for the question that I am hoping to address in this project.
