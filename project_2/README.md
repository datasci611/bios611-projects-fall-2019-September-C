Project 2 README

The data was provided by UMD (Urban Ministry of Durham). Established in 1983, Urban Ministries of Durham works holistically to end homelessness and meet the emergency needs of very poor and hungry neighbors through its programs and in partnership with other nonprofits. UMD is a private, 501(c) 3 non-profit organization governed by a volunteer Board of Directors from the community. UMD offers food, shelter and a future to about 6,000 men, women and children annually. 

Data was provided by UMD (Urban Ministry of Durham). The data is consisted of 79838 observations and 13 variables (5 categorical variables and 8 numerical variables) from years 1931 to 2019. 

I will build an interactive Shiny Dashboard to visualize the trend of the amount of food distributed by UMD over the years.
